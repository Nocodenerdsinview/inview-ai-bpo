// - Analyze KPIs (High quality, Low AHT, etc.)
// - Create strength/weakness profile

// Match:
// - Agent A strong in X, weak in Y
// - Agent B strong in Y, weak in X
// → Suggest peer pairing
```

#### 9.2 Peer Match Suggestions
Dashboard widget showing suggested peer matches:

**Display:**
```
Suggested Peer Matches:
├── Thando (Strong: Empathy) ↔ Maps (Needs: Empathy)
