## Integration

### Dashboard Integration
**Modified:** `/app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx`

The ticker is now positioned at the top of the dashboard, right after the Data Freshness Indicator and before the Quick Actions Toolbar:

```
Dashboard Layout:
├── Data Freshness Indicator
├── Announcement Ticker ← NEW! 🎉
├── Quick Actions Toolbar
├── Today's Priorities
└── ... rest of dashboard
```

This placement ensures announcements are immediately visible when users open the dashboard.

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
- announcements: Array of unacknowledged announcements
- currentIndex: Currently displayed announcement index
- selectedAnnouncement: Modal state for detailed view
- acknowledging: Loading state for acknowledge action
- loading: Initial data fetch state
```

### API Integration
- **Fetch:** `/api/announcements?userId={id}&userRole={role}&includeAcknowledged=false`
- **Acknowledge:** `POST /api/announcements/{id}/acknowledge`
- **Auto-refresh:** Fetches on component mount and user auth changes

### Auto-rotation Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (announcements.length > 1) {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % announcements.length);
    }, 8000); // Rotate every 8 seconds
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [announcements.length]);
```

### Animation Classes
- Custom `@keyframes shimmer` for border animation
- Framer Motion variants for smooth transitions
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
