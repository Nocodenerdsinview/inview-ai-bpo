## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI Analysis Not Working

**Solution:** Add to `.env.local`:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
**Workaround:** Manually fill BI/CI/Comment findings

### Issue: Can't See All Agents
**Cause:** Team Lead isolation (only see your team)  
**Expected:** You should see 8 agents (your team)  
**If Admin:** Would see all agents across all teams

### Issue: Targets Not Showing
**Cause:** No targets set for current month  
**Solution:** Go to `/targets` ‚Üí Set and save targets

### Issue: Leave Conflict Not Detected
**Cause:** No coaching scheduled during those dates  
**Expected:** Only shows warning if actual conflict exists

## üìù Data Entry Best Practices

### For KPIs
- **Daily Entry:** Enter at end of day for today's date
- **Bulk Historical:** Use file upload for past data
- **AHT Breakdown:** Let system auto-calculate, then adjust if needed

### For Audits
- **Transcript First:** Paste transcript, then use AI analysis
- **Review AI Output:** Always review and edit AI suggestions
- **BI vs CI:** BI = process failure, CI = customer impact
- **Link to Coaching:** Check box to auto-create coaching session

### For Coaching
- **Focus Areas:** Start with common, add custom as needed
- **Action Plan:** Be specific and measurable
- **Follow-up:** Always set follow-up date for accountability

### For Leave
- **Check Conflicts:** System auto-checks, but review alert
- **Sick Days Pattern:** More than 5 in 30 days = Flag for discussion
- **Annual Allowance:** Default 25 days/year per agent
