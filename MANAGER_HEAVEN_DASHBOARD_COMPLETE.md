```typescript
{
  quality: {
    value: 89,
    unit: "%",
    target: 90,
    lastWeekValue: 87,
    sparklineData: [85, 87, 86, 88, 89, 90, 89],
    distribution: [
      { label: "Good", count: 6, percentage: 60, color: "#A4E83C" },

2. **Intersection Observer** for animations (only animate when visible)
3. **RequestAnimationFrame** for smooth counter animations
4. **CSS transforms** for hardware-accelerated transitions

### Responsive Design
- **3 columns** on large screens (lg:)
- **2 columns** on medium screens (md:)
- **1 column** on mobile
- **4 columns for agents** on extra-large (xl:)

### Accessibility

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Dashboard API
    ↓
DashboardClient (state management)
    ↓
useMemo (generate rich KPI data)
    ↓
Components (render with animations)
```

1. **Fetch**: API returns agents with latest KPIs
2. **Process**: useMemo calculates distributions, averages, top performers
3. **Generate**: Creates 7-day sparkline data (mock for now)
4. **Render**: Components receive rich data and animate in
5. **Interact**: Hover overlays show coaching insights
