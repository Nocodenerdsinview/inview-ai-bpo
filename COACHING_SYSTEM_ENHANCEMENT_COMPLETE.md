# Coaching System Enhancement - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully fixed coaching generation errors and implemented comprehensive coaching scheduling functionality with agent selection, audit attachment, and enhanced quick prep workflow.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Coaching Generation 500 Error ✅
**Problem**: API required BOTH transcript AND observations, but users wanted flexibility.

**Solution**:
- Updated `/api/coaching/generate/route.ts` validation to accept transcript OR observations (or both)
- Modified `lib/groq.ts` to handle missing data gracefully with helpful notes in prompts
- Updated UI in `/app/coaching/generate/page.tsx` with clearer labels and validation

## New Features Implemented

### 2. API Endpoints Created ✅

#### `/api/agents/[id]/next-coaching/route.ts`
- GET endpoint to fetch agent's next scheduled coaching
- Returns null if no upcoming coaching exists
- Used by quick prep page and scheduling workflows

#### `/api/audits/needs-coaching/route.ts`
- GET endpoint with `agentId` query parameter
- Fetches audits for specific agent that need coaching (score < 75% or no coaching status)
- Filters out completed coaching audits
- Limited to 20 most recent audits

#### `/api/coaching/[id]/add-plan/route.ts`
- PATCH endpoint to add plan to existing coaching session
- Updates: focusAreas, actionPlan, aiPrepContent, developmentAreas, commitments
