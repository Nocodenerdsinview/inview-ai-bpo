# 🚀 ACTION REQUIRED - See Your New Features!

## ✅ Everything Has Been Implemented & Fixed!

### What Was the Problem?
The features were created but **coaching sessions had past dates**, so the "Upcoming Coachings" widget was empty. Additionally, all agents had high scores, so the "Red Flag Agents" widget wasn't showing.

### What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Updated seed script to create **future coaching sessions** (1-14 days ahead)
2. ✅ Reseeded database with **30 upcoming coaching sessions**
3. ✅ Created **2 red flag agents** (Maria Garcia & Nina Kowalski with scores <70%)
4. ✅ Cleared Next.js cache
5. ✅ Verified all APIs are returning data
