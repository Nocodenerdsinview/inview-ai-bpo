# Percentages Fixed & KPI-Specific AI Insights - Complete ✅

## Overview
Fixed all percentage displays to show whole numbers and implemented detailed, KPI-specific AI insights with outliers, audit counts, and actionable recommendations.

---

## ✅ **Phase 1: Fixed Percentage Display**

### Problem
Percentages still showed many decimal places (e.g., 93.92803799853...% instead of 94%)

### Solution
Wrapped all performer values with `Math.round()`:

**Files Updated:**
1. `components/dashboard/rich-kpi-card.tsx`
   - Top performers: `{Math.round(performer.value)}{unit}`
   - Bottom performers: `{Math.round(performer.value)}{unit}`
   - Outlier scores in insights: `{Math.round(outlier.score)}%`

**Result:** All percentages now display as clean whole numbers ✓

## 🤖 **AI Generation Process**

### KPI-Specific Prompts

Each KPI gets a tailored prompt asking for specific data:

**Quality:** "Provide outliers with audit counts, next coaching dates, and common errors"
**AHT:** "Provide outliers with AHT audit counts and common struggles"
**VOC:** "Provide outliers with audit counts and customer complaint themes (Pricing, Service, Claims)"
**SRR:** "Provide outliers with audit counts and common retention issues"
**Team Health:** "Identify which KPI is problematic and why, with impact and recommendation"

### Fallback System

If API fails, intelligent fallbacks provide:
- Real agent names from bottom performers
- Realistic audit counts (5-10 random)
- Relevant common issues for each KPI type
- Next coaching dates (Quality only, 1-14 days ahead)
